What is ML?
Machine learning is the practice of teaching a computer to learn, 
Machine learning is an application of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

Types of ML:
#1. Supervised ML
#2. Unsupervised ML
#3. Reinforcement ML

Supervised : It will have the historical data which is used to predict the o/p from a set of independent features. Simply, first, we train .the machine with 
the input and corresponding output, and then we ask the machine to predict the output using the test dataset.

Unsupervised : Here we won't have labbeled data, inspite the algorithms will use the relation/pattern to predict the outcome.

Semi-supervised learning: This approach to machine learning involves a mix of the two preceding types. Data scientists may feed an algorithm mostly labeled training data, but the model is free to explore the data on its own and develop its own understanding of the data set.

Reinforcement : Data scientists typically use reinforcement learning to teach a machine to complete a multi-step process for which there are clearly defined rules.
